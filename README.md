# Battleship

## Description

This project was made as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The project focuses on Test Driven Development. Tests were done with Jest. 

Some improvements that I would make to this project, if starting from scratch would be:

 - to implement a drag & drop placement of the ships, rather than doing it all through pure logic.
 - improve the AI's logic and add difficulty levels to the game.
